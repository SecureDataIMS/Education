	INTRODUCTION TO CYBERSECURITY
		Computer security. Network security. Information security. Cybersecurity. All of these 
		terms are used to describe the protection of information assets. the objective of 
		information security is threefold, involving the critical components of confidentiality, 
		integrity and availability.
		
		All three components are concerned with the protection of information. Confidentiality 
		means protection from unauthorized access, while integrity means protection from 
		unauthorized modification, and availability means protection from disruptions in access.
		
		In current era of security, there are references to both “cybersecurity” and 
		“information security.” The terms are often used interchangeably, but in reality 
		cybersecurity is a part of information security.
		
		Generally, cybersecurity refers to anything intended to protect enterprises and individuals
		from intentional attacks, breaches, incidents and consequences. More specifically, 
		cybersecurity can be defined as 
		
		“the protection of information assets by addressing threats to information processed, 
		stored and transported by internetworked information systems.”
		
		
		CYBERSECURITY AND SITUATIONAL AWARENESS
			In order to successfully protect their systems and information, cybersecurity 
			professionals must demonstrate a high degree of situational awareness. This 
			type of awareness takes time to cultivate, because it usually develops through
			experience within a specific organization.
			
			Central to this awareness is an understanding of key business and technology 
			factors that affect information security. Numerous factors, both internal and 
			external, can directly impact an organization and its security needs, including:
				• Business plans and business environment
				• Available information technology, security process or systems in particular
				
			With respect to technology, there are many factors that can impact security, such as:
				• Platforms and tools used
				• Network connectivity (internal, third-party, public)
				• Level of IT complexity
				• Operational support for security
				• User community and capabilities
				• New or emerging security tools
				
			When evaluating business plans and the general business environment, consider drivers, such as:
				• Nature of business
				• Risk tolerance
				• Security profile
				• Industry trends for security
				• Mergers, acquisitions and partnerships
					– Consider type, frequency and resulting level of integration
				• Outsourcing services or providers
		
	
	
	DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INFORMATION SECURITY AND CYBERSECURITY 
	
		The terms “cybersecurity” and “information security” are often used interchangeably. 
		Some use the term cybersecurity as a synonym for information security, IT security 
		and information risk management.
		
		Information security deals with information, regardless of its format—it encompasses 
		paper documents, digital and intellectual property in people’s minds, and verbal or 
		visual communications.
		
		Cybersecurity, on the other hand, is concerned with protecting digital assets—everything 
		from networks to hardware and information that is processed, stored or transported by 
		internetworked information systems. Additionally, concepts such as nation-state-sponsored 
		attacks and advanced persistent threats (APTs) belong almost exclusively to cybersecurity. 
		It is helpful to think of cybersecurity as a component of information security.
		
		the term cybersecurity will be defined in this guide as protecting information assets by 
		addressing threats to information processed, stored and transported by internetworked 
		information systems.
		
		PROTECTING DIGITAL ASSETS
			In their cybersecurity frameworks, both the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 
			and the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) have identified 
			five key functions necessary for the protection of digital assets. These functions coincide with 
			incident management methodologies and include the following activities:
			
			• Identify: Use organizational understanding to minimize risk to systems, assets, data and capabilities.
			• Protect: Design safeguards to limit the impact of potential events on critical services and infrastructure.
			• Detect: Implement activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event.
			• Respond: Take appropriate action after learning of a security event.
			• Recover: Plan for resilience and the timely repair of compromised capabilities and services.
			
			
	CYBERSECURITY OBJECTIVES
	
		CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY AND AVAILABILITY 
		
			Confidentiality is the protection of information from unauthorized access or disclosure. Different 
			types of information require different levels of confidentiality, and the need for confidentiality 
			can change over time.
			Personal, financial and medical information require a higher degree of confidentiality than the 
			minutes of a staff meeting, for example. Similarly, some companies need to protect information on 
			competitive future products before their release but may need to make the same information public 
			afterwards.
			
			Data must be protected from improper disclosure according to its sensitivity and applicable legal 
			requirements. The confidentiality of digital information can be maintained using several different 
			means, including access controls, file permissions and encryption.
			
			
			
			Integrity is the protection of information from unauthorized modification. For example, if a bank 
			transfers US $10,000 to another financial institution, it is important that the amount does not 
			change to US $100,000 during the exchange. 
			
			The concept of integrity also applies to software and configurations.Any violation of integrity is 
			significant because it may be the first step in a successful attack against system availability or 
			confidentiality. Contaminated systems and corrupted data must be dealt with immediately to assess 
			the potential for further violation or damage. The integrity of digital assets can be controlled 
			by logging, digital signatures, hashes, encryption and access controls.
			
			
			
			Availability ensures the timely and reliable access to and use of information and systems. This 
			would include safeguards to make sure data are not accidentally or maliciously deleted. 
			This is particularly important with a mission-critical system, because any interruptions in its 
			availability can result in a loss of productivity and revenue.
			
			Similarly, the loss of data can impact management’s ability to make effective decisions and 
			responses. Availability can be protected by the use of redundancy, backups and access control.
		
		[PIC : CIA_RelatedImpact.PNG]
		
		NONREPUDIATION
			Confidentiality, integrity and availability are equally important factors in the process of ensuring 
			nonrepudiation. In a digital context, nonrepudiation refers to the concept that a message or other 
			piece of information is genuine.
			It assures that the data’s integrity has been protected and that the party sending or receiving it 
			cannot deny or repudiate that they sent or received it. Nonrepudiation is important in transactions 
			that require trust, such as financial transactions and legal matters. Nonrepudiation is implemented 
			through transactional logs and digital signatures.
			
			
			
	CYBERSECURITY ROLES
		
		GOVERNANCE, RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE
		
			Governance is the responsibility of the board of directors and senior management of the organization. 
			A governanceprogram has several goals:
				• Provide strategic direction
				• Ensure that objectives are achieved
				• Ascertain whether risk is being managed appropriately
				• Verify that the organization’s resources are being used responsibly
				
			
			Risk management is the process by which an organization manages risk to acceptable levels. 
			Risk management requires the development and implementation of internal controls to manage and mitigate 
			risk throughout the organization, including financial and investment risk, physical risk and cyberrisk.
			
			
			Compliance is the act of adhering to, and the ability to demonstrate adherence to, mandated requirements 
			defined by laws and regulations. It also includes voluntary requirements resulting from contractual 
			obligations and internal policies.

		RISK 
			The Combination of probability of an event and its consequences. Risk is mitigated through
			the use of controls or safeguards.
			
			RESIDUAL RISK : Even after safeguards are in place, there will always be residual risk, defined
			as the remaining risk after management has implemented a risk response.
			
			INHERENT RISK : The risk level or exposure without taking into account the actions that management
			has taken or might take.
			
			APPROACHES TO RISK
				There are a number methodologies available to measure risk
					Risk tolerance
					Size and Scope of the environment in question
					Amount of data available
					
			[PIC : RISKMANAGEMENT_FRAMEWORK.PNG]
			
		THREAT
			Anything that is capable of acting against an asset in a manner that can result in harm.

			information, infrastructure, finances and reputation.
			
		VULNERABILITY 
			A Weakness in the design, implementation, operation or internal control of a proces that could
			expose the system to adverse threats from threat events.
				
			
			
			
		COMMON ATTACK TYPE AND VECTORS
			As attack vectors and methodologies continue to evolve, they represent a significant threat on 
			the client side. Although some attacks are made at random with no particular traget in mind, 
			there are also trageted attacks against recipients who have been reseaerched and identified as 
			useful by attackers.
			
			[PIC : CyberThreatAgents.PNG]
			
			THEAT AGENTS
				CORPORATIONS : Corporations have been known to breach security boundaries and perform 
				malicious acts to gain a competitive advantage.
				
				NATION STATES : Nation states often target government and private entities with a high
				level of sophistication to obtain intelligence or carry out other destructive activities.
				
				HACKTIVISTS : Although they often act independently, politically motivated hackers may
				target specific individuals or organizations to achieve various ideological ends.
				
				CYBERTERRORISTS : Characterized by their willingness to use voilence to achieve their goals,
				cyberterrorists frequently target critical infrastructures and government groups.
				
				CYBERCRIMINALS : Moticated by the desire for profit, these individuals are involved in 
				fraudulent financial transactions.
				
				CYBERWARRIORS : Often likended to hackivists, cyberwarrior, also reffered to as cyberfighters,
				and natinally motivied citizens who may act on behalf of a political party or agains another
				political party that threatens them.
				
				SCRIPT KIDDIES :  Script kiddies are young individuals who are learning to hack; they may work
				alone or with others and are parimarily involved in code injection and distributed denial-of-service
				(DDoS) attacks.
				
				ONLINE SOCIAL HACKERS : Skilled in social engineering, these attackers are frequently involved in
				cyberbullying, indentify theft and collection of other confidential information or credentials.
				
				EMPLOYEES : Although they typically have fairly low-tech methods and tools, dissatisfied current or 
				former employees represent a clear cybersecurity risk. All of those attacks are adversarial,
				
				
				
				ATTACK ATTRIBUTES
					While risk is measured by potential activity, an ATTACK is the actual occurence of a threat. More
					specifically, an attack is an activity by a threat agent against an asset. From an attaker's point
					of view, the asset is a TARGET, and the path or route used to gain access to traget(asset) is 
					know as an ATTACK VECTOR.
					
						INGRESS ATTACK VECTOR -- Intruction into systems, some attackes are designed to remove data from 
						systems and networks.
						
						EGRESS ATTACK VECTOR -- also known as Data Exfiltration
						
					The attacker must defeat any controls in place and/or use an EXPLOIT to take advan of a vulnerability
					Another attribute of an attack is the ATTACK MECHANISM, or the method used to deliver the exploit.
					Unless the attacker is personally performing the attack, the attack mechanism may invlove a PAYLOD, or
					container, that delivers teh exploit to the traget.
					
					[PIC : AttackAttributes.PNG]
					
		
		
		GENERALIZED ATTACK PROCESS
			While each attack is different, most adversarial theat events follow a common process.
			
			[PIC :  ThreatProcess.PNG]
			
			
			PERFORM RESCONNAISSANCE : The adversary gathers information using variety of techniques,
			which may include:
				• Sniffing or Scanning the network perimeter
				• Using Open source discovery of organizational information
				• Running malware to identify potential tragets
				
			CREATE ATTACJ TOOLS : The adversary crafts the tools needed to carry out a future attack,
			which may inlude:
				• Phishing or Spear phishing attacks
				• Crafting couterfeit website or certificates
				• Create and operating false front organization to inject malicious components into the
				supply chain
				
			DELIVER MALICIOUS CAPABILITIES : The adversary inserts or installs whatever is needed to carry
			out the attach, which may include the following tactics:
				• Introducting malware into organizational information systems
				• Placing sobverted invdividuals into previleged positions whith the organization
				• Installing sniffers or scanning devices on targeted networks and systems
				• Inserting tampered hardware or critical components into organizational systems or supply chain
			
			EXPLOIT AND COMPROMISE : The adversary take advantage of information and systems in order to compromise
			them, which may involve the following actions:
				• Split tunneling or gaining physical acccess to organizational facilities
				• Exfiltration data or sensitive information
				• Exploiting multitenancy in a could environment
				• Launching Zero-Day exploits
				
			CONDUCT AN ATTACK : The adversary coordinates attack tools or performs activities that inferfer with
			organizational functions. Potential methos of attack include:
				• Communication interception or wireless jamming attacks
				• Denial-of-service (DoS) or distributed denial-of-service (DDoD) attacks
				• Remote interference with or physical attacks on organizational facilities or infrastructure
				• Session-hijacking or man-in-the-middle attacks

				• Adapting cyberattacks in response to organizational security measures
				
			COORDINATE A CAMPAIGN : The adversary coordinates a compaign against the organization that may involve the 
			following measure:
				• Multi-staged attacks
				• Internal and external attacks
				• Widespread and adaptive attacks
				
				
				
		NONADVERSARIAL THREAT EVENTS
			Although most attackers are result of coordinated effort, there are other events than can pose
			various risk to an organization. Some of the most common Nonadversarial threat events are:
			
			• Mishandling of criticl or sensitive information by authorized users
			• Incorrect privilege settings
			• Fire, flood, hurricane, windstorm or earthquake at primary or backup facilities
			• Introduction of vulnerabilities into software products
			• Pervasive disk errors or other problems caused by aging equipment
			
			
			
		MALWARE AND ATTACK TYPES 
			MALWARE, also called malicious code, is software designed to gain access to targeted computer 
			systems, steal infromation or disrupt computer operations. There are serveral type of malware,
			the most important being computer VIRUSES, network WORMS and TROJAN HORSES, which are differentiated
			by the way in which they operate or spread.
			
			VIRUSES : A computer virus is piece of code that can replicate itself and spread from one computer
			to another. It requires intervention or execution to replicate and/or cause damage.
			
			NETWORK WORMS : A variant of Computer Viruses, which is essentially a piece of self-replicating
			code designed to spread itself across computer networks. It does not require intervention or execution
			to replicate.
			
			TROJAN HORSES : Which is a piece of malware that gain access to targeted system by hiding within a genuine
			application. Trojan Horses are often broken down into categories reflecting their purposes.
			
			BOTNETS : A botet (a tern derived from "robot network") is a large, automated and distributed network of 
			previously compromised computers that can be simyltaneously controlled to launch large-scale attacks
			such as DoS, DDoS.
			
		A number of futher terms are also used to describe more specific types of malware, characterized by
		their purposes. They include:
		
			SPYWARE : A class of malware that gathers information about a person or organization without
			the knowledge of that person or organization.
			
			ADWARE : Designed to present advertisements (generally unwanted) to users.
			
			RANSOMWARE : A class of extortive malware that locks or encrypts data or functions and 
			demands a payment to unlock them.
			
			KEYLOGGER : A class of malware that secretly records user keystorkes and, in some cases, screen content
			
			ROOTKIT : A class of malware that hides the existence of other malware by modifying the underlying OS.
			
		
		OTHER ATTACK TYPES
			In addition to malware, there are many other types of attacks, the MITRE Corporation publishes a 
			catalouge of common attack patterns known as CAPEC - Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and 
			Classification.
			
			APT - ADVANCED PERSISTENT THREATS : Complex and coordinated attacks directed at a specific entiry or
			organization. They require an enormus amount of research and time, often taking onths or even years
			to fully execute.
			
			BACKDOOR : A means of regaining access to a compromised system by installing software or configurating
			existing software to enable remote acess under attacker-defined conditions.
			
			BRUTE FORCE ATTACK : An Attack made by trying all possible combinations of passwords or encryption
			keys until the correct one is found.
			
			BUFFER OVERFLOW : Occurs when a program or process tries to store more data in a buffer than it was
			intended to hold.
			
			CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING (XSS) : A type of injection in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise
			begign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacket uses a web application to send malicious
			code, generally in the form of a broswer side scripts, to a different end user.
			
			DENIAL-OF-SERVICE (DoS) ATTACK : An assault on a service from single sourec that floods it with so many
			requests that it becomes overwhelmed and is either stopped completely or operates at a significantly
			reduce rate.
			
			MAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE ATTACK : An attack strategy in which the attacker intercepts the communication steam
			between two parts of the victim system and then replaces the traffic between the two components with 
			the intruder's own, eventually assuming control of the commucation.
			
			SOCAIL ENGINEERING : Any attempt to exploit socal vulnerabilities to gain access to information and/or
			sytems. It involves a "con game" that tricks other into divulging information or opening malicious software
			or program.
			
			PHISHING : A type of electronic mail (email) attack that attempts to convince a user that the originator is 
			genuine, but with the intention of obtaining information for use in social engineering.
			
			SPEAR PHISHING : An Attack where social engineering techniques are used to masuerade as a trusted party to 
			obtain important information such as passwords from the victim
			
			SPOOFING : Faking the sending address of a transmission in order to gain illegal entry into secure sytem.
			
			SQL INJECTION : Crafted User-Controlled input consisting of SQL syntax is user without proper validation 
			as part of SQL queries.
