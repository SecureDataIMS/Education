	INTRODUCTION TO CYBERSECURITY
		Computer security. Network security. Information security. Cybersecurity. All of these 
		terms are used to describe the protection of information assets. the objective of 
		information security is threefold, involving the critical components of confidentiality, 
		integrity and availability.
		
		All three components are concerned with the protection of information. Confidentiality 
		means protection from unauthorized access, while integrity means protection from 
		unauthorized modification, and availability means protection from disruptions in access.
		
		In current era of security, there are references to both “cybersecurity” and 
		“information security.” The terms are often used interchangeably, but in reality 
		cybersecurity is a part of information security.
		
		Generally, cybersecurity refers to anything intended to protect enterprises and individuals
		from intentional attacks, breaches, incidents and consequences. More specifically, 
		cybersecurity can be defined as 
		
		“the protection of information assets by addressing threats to information processed, 
		stored and transported by internetworked information systems.”
		
		
		CYBERSECURITY AND SITUATIONAL AWARENESS
			In order to successfully protect their systems and information, cybersecurity 
			professionals must demonstrate a high degree of situational awareness. This 
			type of awareness takes time to cultivate, because it usually develops through
			experience within a specific organization.
			
			Central to this awareness is an understanding of key business and technology 
			factors that affect information security. Numerous factors, both internal and 
			external, can directly impact an organization and its security needs, including:
				• Business plans and business environment
				• Available information technology, security process or systems in particular
				
			With respect to technology, there are many factors that can impact security, such as:
				• Platforms and tools used
				• Network connectivity (internal, third-party, public)
				• Level of IT complexity
				• Operational support for security
				• User community and capabilities
				• New or emerging security tools
				
			When evaluating business plans and the general business environment, consider drivers, such as:
				• Nature of business
				• Risk tolerance
				• Security profile
				• Industry trends for security
				• Mergers, acquisitions and partnerships
					– Consider type, frequency and resulting level of integration
				• Outsourcing services or providers
		
	
	
	DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INFORMATION SECURITY AND CYBERSECURITY 
	
		The terms “cybersecurity” and “information security” are often used interchangeably. 
		Some use the term cybersecurity as a synonym for information security, IT security 
		and information risk management.
		
		Information security deals with information, regardless of its format—it encompasses 
		paper documents, digital and intellectual property in people’s minds, and verbal or 
		visual communications.
		
		Cybersecurity, on the other hand, is concerned with protecting digital assets—everything 
		from networks to hardware and information that is processed, stored or transported by 
		internetworked information systems. Additionally, concepts such as nation-state-sponsored 
		attacks and advanced persistent threats (APTs) belong almost exclusively to cybersecurity. 
		It is helpful to think of cybersecurity as a component of information security.
		
		the term cybersecurity will be defined in this guide as protecting information assets by 
		addressing threats to information processed, stored and transported by internetworked 
		information systems.
		
		PROTECTING DIGITAL ASSETS
			In their cybersecurity frameworks, both the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 
			and the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) have identified 
			five key functions necessary for the protection of digital assets. These functions coincide with 
			incident management methodologies and include the following activities:
			
			• Identify: Use organizational understanding to minimize risk to systems, assets, data and capabilities.
			• Protect: Design safeguards to limit the impact of potential events on critical services and infrastructure.
			• Detect: Implement activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event.
			• Respond: Take appropriate action after learning of a security event.
			• Recover: Plan for resilience and the timely repair of compromised capabilities and services.
			
			
	CYBERSECURITY OBJECTIVES
	
		CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY AND AVAILABILITY 
		
			Confidentiality is the protection of information from unauthorized access or disclosure. Different 
			types of information require different levels of confidentiality, and the need for confidentiality 
			can change over time.
			Personal, financial and medical information require a higher degree of confidentiality than the 
			minutes of a staff meeting, for example. Similarly, some companies need to protect information on 
			competitive future products before their release but may need to make the same information public 
			afterwards.
			
			Data must be protected from improper disclosure according to its sensitivity and applicable legal 
			requirements. The confidentiality of digital information can be maintained using several different 
			means, including access controls, file permissions and encryption.
			
			
			
			Integrity is the protection of information from unauthorized modification. For example, if a bank 
			transfers US $10,000 to another financial institution, it is important that the amount does not 
			change to US $100,000 during the exchange. 
			
			The concept of integrity also applies to software and configurations.Any violation of integrity is 
			significant because it may be the first step in a successful attack against system availability or 
			confidentiality. Contaminated systems and corrupted data must be dealt with immediately to assess 
			the potential for further violation or damage. The integrity of digital assets can be controlled 
			by logging, digital signatures, hashes, encryption and access controls.
			
			
			
			Availability ensures the timely and reliable access to and use of information and systems. This 
			would include safeguards to make sure data are not accidentally or maliciously deleted. 
			This is particularly important with a mission-critical system, because any interruptions in its 
			availability can result in a loss of productivity and revenue.
			
			Similarly, the loss of data can impact management’s ability to make effective decisions and 
			responses. Availability can be protected by the use of redundancy, backups and access control.

		NONREPUDIATION
			Confidentiality, integrity and availability are equally important factors in the process of ensuring 
			nonrepudiation. In a digital context, nonrepudiation refers to the concept that a message or other 
			piece of information is genuine.
			It assures that the data’s integrity has been protected and that the party sending or receiving it 
			cannot deny or repudiate that they sent or received it. Nonrepudiation is important in transactions 
			that require trust, such as financial transactions and legal matters. Nonrepudiation is implemented 
			through transactional logs and digital signatures.
			
			
			
	CYBERSECURITY ROLES
		
		GOVERNANCE, RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE
		
			Governance is the responsibility of the board of directors and senior management of the organization. 
			A governanceprogram has several goals:
				• Provide strategic direction
				• Ensure that objectives are achieved
				• Ascertain whether risk is being managed appropriately
				• Verify that the organization’s resources are being used responsibly
				
			
			Risk management is the process by which an organization manages risk to acceptable levels. 
			Risk management requires the development and implementation of internal controls to manage and mitigate 
			risk throughout the organization, including financial and investment risk, physical risk and cyberrisk.
			
			
			Compliance is the act of adhering to, and the ability to demonstrate adherence to, mandated requirements 
			defined by laws and regulations. It also includes voluntary requirements resulting from contractual 
			obligations and internal policies.
